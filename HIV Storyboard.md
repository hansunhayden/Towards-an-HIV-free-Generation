## Introduction

### HIV

The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are two species of Lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that infect humans. Over time, they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),[1][2] a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive.

[75.7 million people](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet) have become infected with HIV since the start of the epidemic.

### SDG Goals

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. Major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people. Maternal and child mortality rates have been reduced, life expectancy continues to increase globally, and the fight against some infectious diseases has made steady progress. 

By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases.

## Current Situation

### **People living with HIV**

In 2019, there were 38.0 million [31.6 million–44.5 million] people living with HIV.

36.2 million [30.2 million–42.5 million] adults.

1.8 million [1.3 million–2.2 million] children (0–14 years).

### New infections

[**1.7 million people](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet) became newly infected with HIV in 2019**

New HIV infections have been reduced by 40% since the peak in 1998.

In 2019, around 1.7 million [1.2 million–2.2 million] people were newly infected with HIV, compared to 2.8 million [2.0 million–3.7 million] people in 1998.

Since 2010, new HIV infections have declined by 23%, from 2.1 million [1.6 million–2.9 million] to 1.7 million [1.2 million–2.2 million] in 2019.

- Since 2010, new HIV infections among children have declined by 52%, from 310 000 [200 000–500 000] in 2010 to 150 000 [94 000–240 000] in 2019.

### Death rate

AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 60% since the peak in 2004.

In 2019, around 690 000 [500 000–970 000] people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, compared to 1.7 million [1.2 million–2.4 million] people in 2004 and 1.1 million [830 000 –1.6 million] people in 2010.

AIDS-related mortality has declined by 39% since 2010.

### Among key populations

The risk of acquiring HIV is:

- 26 times higher among gay men and other men who have sex with men.
- 29 times higher among people who inject drugs.
- 30 times higher for sex workers.
- 13 times higher for transgender people

## Regional Comparison

### HIV is *the* leading cause of death in Southern Africa

It’s *one of* the largest killers globally; but for some countries – particularly across Sub-Saharan Africa, it’s *the* leading cause of death. If we look at the breakdown for South Africa, Botswana or Mozambique – we see that HIV/AIDS tops the list. For countries in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa, deaths from HIV/AIDS [are more than](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause?country=Southern%20Sub-Saharan%20Africa) 50% higher than deaths from heart disease, and more than twice that of [cancer](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer) deaths.

While in Switzerland/US, not in top 10

### In some countries HIV/AIDS is the cause of more than a quarter of all deaths

Globally, 1.7% of deaths were caused by HIV/AIDS in 2017.

This share is high, but masks the wide variations in the toll of HIV/AIDS across the world. In some countries, this share was much higher.

### Death rates are high across Sub-Saharan Africa

**The large health burden of HIV/AIDS across Sub-Saharan Africa is also reflected in death rates.** Death rates measure the number of deaths from HIV/AIDS per 100,000 individuals in a country or region.

### By gender: women living with HIV

Is HIV/AIDS more common in men or women?

There are differences in both the prevalence of HIV and death rates from AIDS between men and women. The chart shows the share of women in populations living with HIV.

**As we see, HIV prevalence tends to be higher in women across Sub-Saharan Africa, although higher in males across most other regions.** The trend in AIDS-related deaths shows the opposite: more men tend to to die from AIDS every year than women. The reasons for differences in prevalence and death rates are complex; however, in general, across Sub-Saharan Africa women tend to be infected with HIV earlier than men and survive longer (explaining both the higher prevalence and lower annual AIDS deaths in women). There are a number of gender inequality and social norm issues which result in higher prevalence of HIV in females across many countries; women are at greater risk when they have a limited role in sexual decision-making and protection, role rates of sexual education and higher rates of transactional sex[2](https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids#note-2).

**Consistent problem: the share does not go down according to time series data**

High share of women -> children with HIV high share

### Among young adults/children: living with HIV

**In children with HIV, transmission has typically occurred from the mother (mother-to-child-transmission; MTCT) either during pregnancy or childbirth, or through breastfeeding.** The chart shows the total number of children aged 14 years old and under who are living with HIV. Globally the number of children living with HIV peaked in 2005 at approximately 2.1 million. This has since declined to 1.8 million in 2017.

## Treatment & Prevention

Strong domestic and international commitment and funding for the AIDS response has fueled an acceleration of evidenced-based programs for prevention, testing and treatment. As a result, 

**Global HIV incidence among adults declined by 22 per cent between 2010 and 2017**, well short of the progress required to meet the **2020 and 2030 targets**. 

**What should we do?**

### Anti-retroviral treatment (ART)

- [25.4 million people](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet) were accessing antiretroviral therapy in 2019.

[rate of people receiving treatment]

[ deaths averted by ART [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hivaids-deaths-and-averted-due-to-art](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hivaids-deaths-and-averted-due-to-art)]

- **People who use ART are living longer**

    ART not only saves lives but also gives a chance for people living with HIV/AIDS to live long lives. Without ART very few infected people survive beyond ten years.[3](https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids#note-3)

    Today, a  person living in a high-income country who started ART in their twenties can expect to live for another 46 years — that is well into their 60s.[4](https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids#note-4)

    While the life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS in high-income countries has still not reached the [life expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy) of the general population, we are getting closer to this goal.

- **ART prevents new HIV infections**

    ART reduces the number of viral particles present in an HIV-positive individual and therefore, the likelihood of passing the virus to another person decreases.

    The chances of HIV positive mother transmitting the virus to a child are between 15% and 45%. Effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services can reduce the chances of virus transmission to newborn to 5%. From the chart (link to among young children), we could tell an remarkable decrease in children infection, as a result of antiretroviral therapy across the world.

### Getting people tested

Getting people tested is the first step to prevent transmission and increase ART coverage.

81% [68–95%] of all people living with HIV knew their HIV status.

About 7.1 million people did not know that they were living with HIV.

### Education

the incidence of HIV among adults (15 to 49 years of age) in sub-Saharan Africa declined by around **37** per cent from 2010 to 2017. This represents a drop **from 3.39 infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2010 to 2.14 in 2017**. **Progress has been slower elsewhere, and some sub-regions have even seen an increase in HIV incidence, including Western Asia (53 per cent), Central Asia (51 per cent) and Europe (22 per cent).**

[chart for data below here]

- Key populations and their sexual partners account for

    62% of new HIV infections globally.

    99% of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia.

    97% of new HIV infections in the Middle East and North Africa.

    96% of new HIV infections in western and central Europe and North America.

    98% of new HIV infections in Asia and the Pacific.

    77% of new HIV infections in Latin America.

    69% of new HIV infections in western and central Africa.

    60% of new HIV infections in the Caribbean.

    28% of new HIV infections in eastern and southern Africa.

As we could tell from the difference between developed and developing regions, expanding treatment is not enough for decreasing HIV. Education on prevention of HIV, especially on health sex is also required.

### Eliminate discrimination

The consequences of societal stigma against PLHIV are quite severe, as HIV/AIDS discrimination actively hinders access to HIV/AIDS screening and care around the world.

There is a cyclical relationship between stigma and HIV; people who experience stigma and discrimination are marginalized.  Some people refuse to get tested and treated due to dear of stigmatization and discrimination. Social exclusion, economic vulnerability and a lack of employment opportunities also means poverty, and that sex work is often the most viable form of income. This makes them more vulnerable to HIV, while those living with HIV are more vulnerable to experiencing stigma and discrimination.
